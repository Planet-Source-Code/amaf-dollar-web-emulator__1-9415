## dollar\-web emulator


</div>

### Description

never released on planetsourcecode.com is a paidforsurf emulator. i created this in about 5minutes with inet, not that useless web-browser component. it's very small and very simple. you can play around with the code to get it to look good or whatever. but the planetsourcecode database is in need for a program like this, so here. also, this is not one of those fakesurf programs which make it impossible to use your computer while that's on, this emulates the hours for you, while do whatever, make lot's of money with no effort :]
